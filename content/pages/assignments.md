## Problem sets

Eight problem sets will be given throughout the semester. Problem sets will contain analytical questions and mathematical proofs. Each problem set will be graded on the scale of (+, !, âˆ’) and contribute equally toward the calculation of the final grade. The following instructions will apply to all problem sets unless otherwise noted.

Late submission will not be accepted unless you ask for special permission from the instructor in advance. (Permission may be granted or not granted, with or without penalty, depending on the specific circumstances.)
