## Problem sets

Seven problem sets will be given throughout the semester. Problem sets will contain analytical questions and mathematical proofs. Each problem set will be graded on the scale of (+, ✔, −) and contribute equally toward the calculation of the final grade. The following instructions will apply to all problem sets unless otherwise noted.

- Late submission will not be accepted unless you ask for special permission from the instructor in advance. (Permission may be granted or not granted, with or without penalty, depending on the specific circumstances.)
- Working in groups is encouraged, but each student must submit their own write-up of the solutions. We also ask you to write down the names of the other students with whom you solved the problems together on the first sheet of your solutions.
- For analytical questions, you should include your intermediate steps, as well as comments on those steps when appropriate. All results should be presented so that they can be easily understood.
- Students are strongly encouraged to use LaTeX to write up their solutions; handwritten solutions must       
    be clearly legible.

The problem sets are worth 50% of the course grade.

## Final problem set

The final assignment of the term will be a special problem set, which will be weighted more heavily toward the calculation of the final grade. You will not be allowed to collaborate with anybody on the final problem set. This is to check if you have developed sufficient experience to work through problems on your own. The assignment will be due on the last day of class.

The final problem set is worth 40% of the course grade.
