## COURSE MEETING TIMES

Lectures: 1 session / week; 2 hours / session

Recitations: 1 session / week; 1 hour / session

## Overview and Goals

This course provides an introduction to game theoretic analysis in political science. We study the concepts    
andmodels used to analyze political behavior in strategic contexts, including normal and extensive    
form games, games of incomplete information, repeated games, and bargaining.

*Note to undergraduates*: In order to get the [HASS](https://registrar.mit.edu/registration-academics/academic-requirements/hass-requirement) credit, please make sure to enroll in 17.811 (17.810 is   
the course number for graduate students). The topics covered in this class represent only a very small   
subset of political science research. If you enjoy this class, please consider a HASS concentration in   
[Political Science](https://polisci.mit.edu/).

## PREREQUISITES

*Willingness to work hard on unfamiliar materials*. Understanding of the multivariate calculus equivalent  
to the contents covered in the department’s second math camp course. (If you did not complete the  
math camp, contact the instructor to see if you have enough background.) The course will occasionally  
rely on some methods of mathematical proof (e.g., proof by contradiction, proof by induction, etc.), but  
prior exposure to them is not assumed.
